# Node Voltage Analyzer with Rust

This project uses the Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) to obtain the voltage at the nodes of the
circuit. Where the circuit is feeded to the program in the form of a netlist, similar to those
used in PSPICE-like software.

### How it works

Everything is more clearly understood with an example.
